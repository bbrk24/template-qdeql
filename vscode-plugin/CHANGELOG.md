# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Illegal source characters, such as parentheses, are now highlighted as `invalid.illegal.tqdeql`.
- Variable references on the RHS of assignment are now properly highlighted.
- <code>&bsol;&sol;</code> are now classified as a bracket pair, so a newline between them automatically adds indentation.

## 0.1.0 - 2024-10-06

Initial Release.
